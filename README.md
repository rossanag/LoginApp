# React 18 LoginApp

### In progress

It began as project to understand OAuth2 protocol for authentication, but as things were caming I decided to go further to the cover different concepts involved when programming a webapp. 
Therefore the name of this repository (LoginApp) is misleading, since it will be a more complete fullstack app.


I will summarize the aspects that are involved, to delve into them later:

- [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol for authentication
- Global state with Redux
- Managing routes in UX
- Server app with [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for practicing non relational database
- Testing

(Some of them are about to be implemented or are incomplete)





## Introduction

It is a React 18 App created with Vite. It uses Typescript and Tailwindcss. The skeleton of this project is based on my [react-vite repository](https://github.com/rossanag/react-vite). There you'll find all the installations and configuration I needed.

Operative System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
